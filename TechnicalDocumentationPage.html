            <header>Section 1 Introduction to C</header>
            <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language that has been used in the development of various software applications. This section provides an introduction to C, its history, and its key characteristics.</p>
            <code>// Sample code illustrating a basic 'Hello, World!' program in C</code>
            <p>We'll cover the basic structure of a C program, including the inclusion of header files and the 'main' function. Additionally, you'll gain insight into the importance of comments in your code.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Discuss the history and significance of C</li>
                <li>Introduce the basic structure of a C program</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Section_2_Variables">
            <header>Section 2 Variables</header>
            <p>Variables are fundamental elements in C programming, used to store and manipulate data. This section delves into the world of variables, data types, and variable declaration in C.</p>
            <code>// Sample code demonstrating the declaration and initialization of variables in C</code>
            <p>We'll explore different data types like int, float, and char, and how to use them effectively. You'll also learn about naming conventions and best practices for variable usage.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain the concept of variables and their importance</li>
                <li>Discuss different data types and their usage</li>

            <header>Section 3 Control Structures</header>
            <p>Control structures in C enable decision-making and repetition. This section provides an in-depth understanding of control structures, including if statements, loops, and switch statements.</p>
            <code>// Sample code illustrating if statements and loops in C</code>
            <p>We'll cover the syntax and usage of control structures to create conditional logic and repetitive tasks. Control structures are essential for controlling the flow of a C program.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain the purpose of control structures</li>
                <li>Provide examples of if statements and loops</li>

            <header>Section 4 Functions</header>
            <p>Functions are a key component of C programming, enabling code modularity and reusability. This section explores function definition, invocation, and best practices in C.</p>
            <code>// Sample code for defining and calling functions in C</code>
            <p>We'll discuss the structure of functions, including parameters and return values. You'll also learn about function prototypes and their importance. Functions help organize and simplify your code.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain the concept of functions and their benefits</li>

            <header>Section 5 Pointers</header>
            <p>Pointers are a unique feature of C that allow direct memory manipulation. In this section, we'll explore pointers, memory addresses, and their role in working with data at a lower level.</p>
            <code>// Sample code demonstrating pointer usage in C</code>
            <p>We'll cover the basics of pointers, including declaration, initialization, and pointer arithmetic. You'll also learn how pointers are crucial for working with arrays and complex data structures.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain the concept of pointers and their significance</li>
